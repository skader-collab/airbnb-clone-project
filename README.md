# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
# Team Roles
1. Sekou S kamaera Backend-developer
2. Meek Dukuly- Database admin
3. Kader Kamara- Frontend-developer
# Technology Stack

- **Django**: A robust Python web framework for building the backend, managing database models, user authentication, and providing APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used to persist and manage structured data.
- **GraphQL**: An API query language that allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, improving efficiency and flexibility.
## Database Design

   - `id`: Unique identifier for each property.
   - `title`: Name or title of the property listing.
   - `description`: Detailed information about the property.
   - `address`: Location of the property.
   - `owner_id`: References the `id` of the user who owns the property.

3. **Bookings**
   - `id`: Unique identifier for each booking.
   - `user_id`: References the `id` of the user who made the booking.
   - `property_id`: References the `id` of the booked property.
   - `start_date`: Booking start date.
   - `end_date`: Booking end date.

4. **Reviews**

   - `user_id`: References the `id` of the user who wrote the review.
   - `property_id`: References the `id` of the reviewed property.
   - `rating`: Numeric rating score.
   - `comment`: Text of the review.

5. **Payments**
   - `id`: Unique identifier for each payment.
   - `booking_id`: References the `id` of the related booking.
   - `amount`: Total payment amount.
   - `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed, failed).
   - `payment_date`: Date the payment was made.

### Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** can have one **Payment**.
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This feature ensures that only registered users can book properties or list their own properties for rent.

### Property Management
Property owners can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes detailed information, photos, pricing, and availability to help guests find suitable accommodations.

### Booking System
Guests can search for available properties, view details, and make reservations for specific dates. This system handles availability checks, prevents double bookings, and tracks all reservations.

### Review System
After a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This helps maintain quality and trust within the platform, allowing future guests to make informed choices.

### Payment Integration
Secure payment processing is integrated to handle booking payments. This feature ensures transactions are tracked, payment statuses are updated, and owners receive payouts for successful bookings.

### Search and Filtering
Guests can search for properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability. Advanced filtering improves the user experience by helping guests find the perfect property quickly.

### Admin Dashboard
Admins can manage users, properties, bookings, and payments from a centralized dashboard. This feature supports moderation and ensures the platform runs smoothly and securely.

## API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is critical for protecting sensitive user information, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining trust in the platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
All API endpoints will require user authentication, typically using token-based methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources and perform actions such as booking a property or managing listings.

### Authorization
Role-based access control will be enforced to ensure that users can only perform actions they are permitted to. For example, guests can book properties but cannot edit property details, while owners can manage their own listings but not those of others.

### Input Validation and Data Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This protects the database and application integrity.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
API rate limiting will be applied to prevent abuse and protect against brute force attacks. This ensures fair usage and prevents any single user from overwhelming the server.

### HTTPS and Data Encryption
All API requests and responses will be transmitted over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This prevents sensitive information like passwords and payment details from being intercepted.

### Secure Payments
Payment APIs will comply with industry security standards (e.g., PCI DSS) to handle transactions safely, ensuring users' financial data remains secure.

Implementing these security measures helps protect user data, secure transactions, prevent unauthorized actions, and maintain a safe and reliable platform for all users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates are delivered to users quickly, reliably, and with minimal manual intervention.  

Implementing CI/CD improves development efficiency by catching issues early through automated tests, enforcing consistent build processes, and enabling rapid deployment to production or staging environments.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** will be used to automate testing and deployment workflows. **Docker** will be used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, staging, and production. Additional tools like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean** can be integrated for streamlined deployment and scaling.

By setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline, the team can maintain high code quality, reduce deployment risks, and deliver new features to users faster and more reliably.
